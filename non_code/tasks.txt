overall idea:
- chat app with user accounts
	- live interaction that's not text is likes counter on each message
	- multimedia content is a profile pic
	- notification and private dm page
- so 3-4 pages: main chat page, login and create account, private dm page
- use socket io for server

notes:
- Basically what u need to do is: 1. When client send a message, OnSend() will be triggered, and when this is triggered, client send something to the server, so the server knows and relay to the specific client.       2. When a client receive a message/ command from server, parse it and get the message and get the name  who is sending this message then call AssMessage(_username, _msg), then u dont need to worry about the frontend anymore, this method will do the rest for you
other methods will works the same way

database:
-i will be sending the data to the database in JSON, so you'll have to decode that or whatever
or maybe not JSON if you or i figure out a better way, ive been thinking about this for 5 minutes
